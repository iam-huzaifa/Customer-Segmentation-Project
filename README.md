# Customer-Segmentation-Project
This project applies K-Means clustering to the Mall Customers dataset to group shoppers into distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score. The goal is to identify customer patterns, such as high-income high-spenders or low-income low-spenders, which can help businesses design targeted marketing strategies.
